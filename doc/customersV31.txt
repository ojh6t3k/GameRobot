Run vbrun60sp6.exe for installation, if all goes well then, just run the hx19 executable files directly. If there is an error it may be worth going through the hx19 installation found in the "utility software" folder 

If you are running more than 5 receivers at the same RF frequency channel, please make sure you read about the q switch in the hx19 manual. 

In case of trouble with ftdi drivers goto
